                        <p>The target audience of the video is people whose lives are greatly affected by video games or other types of technology. The social issue depicted in this episode of South Park, is that nowadays many people spend a lot of their time video gaming. This can become a serious problem as more and more people are attracted to video games and get addicted to them. In fact, just like addictive drugs can have harmful effects on people on the long run, so do video games. If someone spends too much time playing them, the risk is that they will end up separating themselves from reality, and not having any type of social interactions, outside of the game. Social interactions, even though many people don't realize it, are a very important part of people's lives, and help them maintain mental as well as physical stability. I think, that the bad effects that too much video gaming can have on people is mainly what the creators of the show were trying to portray. In fact, throughout the episode when they referred to players who had achieved higher levels in the game, and had therefore played for a longer time, as people with 'no life'. This means that those people spent so much time on the video game that they ended up being completely detached from reality and deprived of any social interaction. This, in my opinion, was the creators' view on this particular social issue.</p>
