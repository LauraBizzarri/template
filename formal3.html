			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>To be able to explain the role that research, communication and technology play within Entomology, first it is important to understand what this discipline is. Entomology  is defined as the discipline that studies insects. However, this is not an exhaustive definition. In fact, entomology is not simply the study of insects in general, it includes the interactions of such insects with humans and the environment, as well as how we can control insects that cause damage and help those that are useful to humans. A lot of the work done within entomology involves pest control in crops that are a food source for us humans. Therefore, it is important to note that entomologists play a major role behind the scenes of crop production. In fact, some sort of insect can damage almost all fruit and vegetables that we eat, or at least cook with. It is an entomologistâ€™s job to help control such pests with either insecticides or other beneficial insects, which one is better, the entomologist has to determine based on many factors such as cost and availability. Nevertheless, all of these tasks that entomologists have to complete, cannot be concluded without the aid of research, communication and technology.</p>
