			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>Research is one of the most important factors in Entomology. In fact, most of what scientists know today about insects and everything that is related to them has been discovered and tested through research. Most of the work done today within Entomology is based on research about a specific topic. Usually the type of research done within entomology involves observations and collection of data. It is based on the data that researchers gather that they can eventually understand if what they are studying is consistent with their initial hypothesis. Often times the outcome of research within entomology is applied to related fields, such as agriculture and botany. Furthermore, it is important to consider how research is greatly influenced by communication, be it writing, talking, emailing, or even texting, and technology.</p>
