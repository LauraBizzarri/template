			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>A cultural artifact that, in my opinion, depicts the social issue of classism quite well , is the contemporary TV show Gossip Girl. In this show, are portrayed the lives of some high school students from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City. From the very beginning, we see their interactions with each other, in and out of their prestigious elite school, which is shown as if it was a completely separate world, were these teenagers live their apparently perfect lives, with little if no preoccupations for the ‘outside’ world and what happens in it. In the first episode the show also introduces to the audience two other students at that same prestigious school, and it can immediately be understood that they are considered the ‘outsiders’. This is mostly because they live in Brooklyn and not Manhattan as all the other students, and they don’t come from a particularly wealthy family.  It is in the interactions between these two students, considered ‘outsiders’, and their schoolmates that, I think, the issue of classism is the most evident. In fact, most students don’t even know about their existence, and those who do, don’t miss a chance to pick on them for their social status. It is as if the whole worth of a person were based on where they come from and how wealthy their family is, and this is what classism ultimately is.  The TV show, I believe, depicts some of the main characteristics of classism, even if sometimes they are exaggerated. In fact, it is important to understand that what it is shown on Gossip Girl, isn’t always the case, and that the issue of classism, along with other social issues on which the TV show is centered, are brought to the extremes, to make it more ‘entertaining’ for the audience. </p>
