			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, many are the ways in which classism can affect people’s lives, but it is very important that more and more people start recognizing these ways. As the TV show Gossip Girl, that I have analyzed as a cultural artifact, demonstrated, the issue can affect kids and teenagers, who are in a developmental phase of their lives and it is, therefore, important that they can find people to turn to for help. However, this can only happen if knowledge is first raised about the subject, both in the academic field and not. In fact, without the knowledge there’s little that either specialists, or even teachers, parents and friends can do, to help others. If the process of spreading the knowledge can be carried out adequately, this could ultimately lead to a decrease in events, such as bullying, that have at their root the prejudice that comes with classism. </p>
