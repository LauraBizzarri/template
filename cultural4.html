			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Classism is an issue that has affected people’s lives ever since a class system has emerged in society, which means almost ever since civilized societies exist. Within classism, “People occupying lower social class levels, are treated in ways that exclude, devalue, and separate them” (Regina, 2007). Even so, although it is a long-standing issue, until fairly recently very few people acknowledged it as a true problem. Fortunately, it is becoming more and more common for people to recognize it, and “It is promising to note that, although work still remains to be done, there is an emergent body of literature beginning to shed light on the attributions for poverty, negative attitudes and prejudice toward poor people” (Ritz, 2008). There’s also increasingly more research being conducted regarding the social issue of classism, particularly considering it from a psychological and social perspective. What this research that is being carried out helps to achieve is that it will be easier for people to recognize the problem and then for specialists, such as psychologists, to help those affected by it, cope with it. What many people still don’t comprehend is that classism, and therefore the prejudice that comes with it, put a lot of psychological pressure on the targeted individuals, often causing them to develop further psychological disabilities, such as depression. Another factor that makes classism even worse is the fact that it is very often accompanied by other acts, such as bullying. Unfortunately, both classism and bullying, are very common among students, particularly in situations where, for many diverse reasons, they are not closely followed by teachers or parents. Teenagers and kids, that experience the detrimental effects of classism and bullying, are at a phase of their lives, in which they are developing to become adults. It is in these phases, that people are the most vulnerable to such issues, and more prone to developing psychological disabilities that, if not recognized and treated with the right method, they will bring along with themselves throughout their whole lives. However, classism doesn’t only affect the lives of kids and teenagers, it can have a big influence in adults’ lives as well. In fact, because of the stigma that comes with classism, people are often cut out of social interactions and jobs as well. Unfortunately, there are still many people today that think that if someone is poor or comes from a lower social class, it means that their lazy or stupid, but most of the times this is not the case. By thinking this way people tend to cut out and deprive others of opportunities they could have were there not the stigma. </p>
