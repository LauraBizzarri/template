			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Classism is an issue that has affected people’s lives since a class system has emerged in society. Within classism, “People occupying lower social class levels, are treated in ways that exclude, devalue, and separate them” (Regina, 2007). Nonetheless, even if it’s a long standing issue, until fairly recently very few people acknowledged it as a true problem. In fact, it is becoming more and more common for people to recognize it, and “It is promising to note that, although work still remains to be done, there is an emergent body of literature beginning to shed light on the attributions for poverty, negative attitudes and prejudice toward poor people” (Ritz, 2008). There’s also increasingly more research being conducted regarding the social issue of classism, particularly considering it from a psychological and social perspective. What this research that is being carried out helps to achieve is that it will be easier for people to recognize the problem and then for specialists, such as psychologists to help those affected by it cope with it. What many people still don’t realize is that classism, and therefore the prejudice that comes with it, put a lot of psychological pressure on the targeted individuals, often causing them to develop further psychological disabilities. Another thing that worsens classism is the fact that it is very often accompanied by other acts, such as bullying. Both classism and bullying, are very common among students, particularly in situations where, for many diverse reasons, they are not closely followed by teachers or parents. Teenagers and kids, that experience the detrimental effects of classism and bullying, are at a phase of their lives, in which they are developing, to become adults. It is therefore, that people are the most vulnerable to such issues, and more prone to developing psychological disabilities that, if not recognized and treated with the right method, they will bring along with themselves throughout their whole lives. </p>
