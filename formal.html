			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>The purpose of my research project is to analyze and describe how communication through writing, research and technology are employed within entomology. Entomology is defined as the discipline that studies insects. However, this is not an exhaustive definition. In fact, entomology is not simply the study of insects in general, it includes the interactions of such insects with humans and the environment, as well as how we can control insects that cause damage and help those that are useful to humans. Research is a fundamental part of this discipline, as most of what entomologists know today is based on research. All the areas of study that entomology includes use research to backup theories and possibly find solutions to the problems theyâ€™re researching about. Communication is also important within entomology as it helps to share ideas and research results. The type of communication that occurs within entomology is what could be called a scientific communication. In fact, usually papers written about entomological topics, have the purpose to communicate the results of studies to other people within the entomology area of study. When this is not the case, the writing that occurs within entomology has mainly the goal of providing news, but still to people within entomology or related fields. Another important thing in entomology is technology. The main type of technology used within entomology is one that helps facilitate communication between people within the field. Another type of technology just as important as the first one, is the one that help researchers actually conduct research. In fact, most of the data is analyzed through computers. However, it is not just computers that are useful to entomologists there are many other types of technology that are employed within entomology.</p>
