			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The purpose of this project will be to address how communication and technology influence the discipline of Entomology. I will explain how these affect the research done within this discipline, by allowing researchers to organize and communicate their results, share ideas with each other and interact with the public. I will also address how communication and research influence the everyday responsibilities that researchers and people who work in fields related to the discipline have to face. The tasks that researchers can accomplish through various methods of communication as well as technology include creating a relationship with growers and farmers that might be interested in the research that the entomologists are doing on a particular pest, teaching major concepts related to the discipline, and talk at conferences. To accomplish this, I will explain first the role of communication, taking into account a research paper that I will use as an example, as well as two interviews conducted with two professors in the Department of Entomology at MSU. I will then go on to examine the role of technology in the discipline, with the help of an article from a trade publication, and the two previously mentioned interviews. </p>
