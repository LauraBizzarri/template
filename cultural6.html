			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>The effects of research and education, if done in a proper way, would be in my opinion beneficial to those whose lives are directly affected by classism. Research on classism would help broaden knowledge about the social issue, to understand truly how it works and why people develop that kind of prejudice and stigma towards people of a lower social status. The knowledge gained through classism could then be applied in the education step of the solution process. In fact, once researchers and specialists know with more accuracy what classism is, then they can help other people understand it too through education. Thanks to education more and more would be able to recognize the issue and hopefully they would know how to react, in order to intervene in time. When people know what are the signs that they have to look for that will help recognize classism, itâ€™s much easier for someone who is a victim of classism to get help, and also for parents, teachers and friends to help those in need to get the help thy require. Therefore, the effect will hopefully be a decrease in such stigmatization and prejudice towards people from a lower social status. </p>
