                        <h1>Remix Project Memo</h1>
                        <p>The subject of our multimedia remix project was not a social issue but instead the major of advertising. However, even this choice greatly affected how we worked on the project. In fact, we always had to keep in mind that he audience our documentary is addressed to, is most likely going to know very little if anything about the major of advertising. Having to be precise about our content so that the documentary would give the audience a clear idea about what advertising is, also made us dig deeper for information on the topic. This way, I was able to learn many things about advertising and to understand in more detail all the mechanisms behind it. I think that one problem we had, in particular at the beginning, was how to organize the different topics we wanted to show the audience so that the documentary could be the most effective. Therefore, I believe that the audience’s main role in the creation of the documentary was to help us focus on clarity and at the same time giving important information.</p>
                        <p>The main reason we chose this topic was because of its interest not only to the public but to us too. In fact, even though most of us new a few things about advertising, it was only one of our group members who had a deeper knowledge about the subject. Therefore, I would say that interest and curiosity was the main reason behind our choice. The most challenging part of the project for me was to find information about the topic that could be interesting and at the same time convey important information to the audience. I think this was particularly a challenge for me, because before this project I knew very little about the topic. Trying to find information on my own and then checking with the other group members and in particular with Dom, who is the only one of us majoring in advertising, was a good approach to my problem.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion the internet and specifically Google and YouTube were the most useful resources for our research on the topic. Due to the manner in which we used resources no resource proved non-beneficial.</p>
                        <p>Because we were able to get together regularly and split the work load relatively evenly we were able to work well together with few problems arising in the process. Largely due to the ability to distribute the work load amongst each other working in a group proved extremely effective and useful.</p>
                        <p>We planned in advance in such a way as to ensure we would all be able to work together and have all of the information necessary to succeed. If given another chance I think I would like to attempt to manage the time we had better and perhaps add additional information we weren’t able to find a way to fit in the current time span.</p>
                        <p>The way in which we organized and presented the information (i.e. the use of examples and the presentation of information necessary for the understanding of the aforementioned) should prove to be the most effective part of our design. Design decisions were made in an effort to incorporate everyone’s ideas as well as to make those viewing understand the material with the most ease.</p>
