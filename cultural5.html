			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>It can be quite challenging to find a solution for such a broad and widespread, and yet not commonly recognized, social issue as classism is. Nonetheless, in my opinion, two fundamental steps towards a solution are research and education. These might seem a very, maybe even too broad, of a solution, but it is necessary that first people truly understand what classism means, where it is most likely to occur, and what are some signs that might help them recognize it, within their community. In fact, one of the main problems concerning classism is that many people, even within the academic field, still don’t acknowledge it. Psychologists themselves have admitted that “clarity about social class and classism and the situating of both constructs within a theory are imperative” (Liu, 2006). One of the reasons for this is that there hasn’t been much of a focus on this issue, and therefore there hasn’t been much research conducted about it. It is important that specialists such as psychologists and sociologists, understand the mechanisms by which classism affects people’s lives, so that they can start making hypotheses about possible answers to the problem. However, this is only possible if research has been carried out first, across multiple populations and places, to find the commonalities, if there are any. If specialists don’t understand classism before other people, first of all there will be no one helping people understand it, and in addition there will be no one to help those affected by it. The other step that in my opinion is fundamental toward the solution of classism as a social issue is education. This is an important phase in getting people to be able to recognize the problem and to know how to act once they do. The places where I think the education step should start are schools. In fact, both students and their teachers should be taught what some signs of classism are and also what are some things they could do if they notice it. It is very common nowadays for teachers and parents to be asked to look out for bullying among their kids; just as they are asked to be aware of acts of bullying, they should be able to be aware of classism as well. It might be that if they start from bullying and dig deeper, they will find that the cause of it was classism. This, I think, would be particularly true for schools and areas where there is somewhat of a diversity among students’ families’ social status, by that meaning that there are both students coming from a wealthy family and those coming from a poor family.  However, since it’s not only kids and teenagers who are affected by this issue, it is important that knowledge about the subject is raised not only in schools, but in the whole society, through events, conferences and meetings. </p>
