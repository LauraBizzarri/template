			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>Writing is a major form of communication used in Entomology as it provides researchers with a way of reaching out to other scientists within the field or other related fields, and to people, who are not scientist, but who for some reason are interested in the outcomes of the research. Therefore, writing is a very powerful mean of communication for Entomology as it can be shaped around the topic that the writer wishes to expose, as well as around the audience the paper or article is directed to. Dr. Rufus Isaacs, professor and researcher in the Department of Entomology at Michigan State University, works on projects related to berry crops. In his daily job, Professor Isaacs says, communication is essential, because it gives him the ability to share ideas clearly, whether with his colleagues, the students and researchers who work in his lab or the growers that attend the extension meetings that he runs on farm management. There are different types of communication that play a major role in Entomology, according to Professor Isaacs, but the two main kinds are writing and talking. Writing, gives Dr. Isaacs and many others like him, the possibility to expose the results of experiments run in the lab, mostly through scientific papers. What characterizes these is the language used in them and the audience they are directed to. In fact, in scientific papers, the language used is a more specific one, that employs technical terms of the discipline that are understandable mostly to other people within the discipline. Therefore, the kind of language used in scientific papers also defines the audience that is most likely to read such papers. One source that I would like to discuss is a research paper on the nesting behavior of honeybees by Neumann, Peter, et al. This scientific paper explains the purpose, the method and the conclusions of a study conducted on the nesting behavior of giant honey-bees.  The reason why I think this is a good article is that it shows how writing is used within entomology to communicate the results of research that has been carried out. In fact, the article first explains what the purpose of the researcher was, then it goes on to describe the methods used to conduct such research and its related observations, it exposes the results of the research and finally how these results affect the original hypothesis. It is important, however, to notice that this kind of paper because of the language it uses is directed towards a scientific audience. In fact, even though the writers do give some general background information, there is not enough for someone who doesn’t already have some previous knowledge about the topic, to fully understand and appreciate the meaning of such findings. Another characteristic of this research paper that I would like to underline, is the fact that the writers have inserted some images, to help communicate their findings even more clearly. The types of images they have used for such a purpose are tables of that data they have collected. This type of visual communication is a very common one throughout Entomology and other scientific disciplines in general, mainly because it provides the reader with another way of understanding the research and its results, it allows to have some sort of proof. However, even such forms of visual communication (see table 1) that can be integrated into written communication, can limit the audience that is most likely to read the paper. In fact, even such tables of data, or graphs, require some knowledge of the topic, or at least of some basics of data analysis, in order to be clearly comprehended. Therefore, this along with the language used, is another factor that entomologists have to be careful with when communicating in a written form. </p>
			<p>Papers, according to Dr. Grieshop, professor in the Department of Entomology at Michigan State Univeristy, are usually directed to a scientific audience or to grant providers. The latter, is another very common form of communication through writing in Entomology, as most projects that researchers work on are funded through grants. This kind of paper, has a very similar language and content to a scientific paper, but the tone  in this case, according to Dr. Grieshop, is not just expository but also persuasive. In fact, through the paper the researcher has to be able to convince the grant providers that his or her project is worth the money they are providing and that he will be able to provide significant results. These first two types of papers are the most commonly occurring type of writing within Entomology. </p>
			<p>Along with scientific and grant papers there are other types of written communication, such as articles for trade publications, textbooks and web pages. I will explore the latter one in more detail when I get to explaining the role of technology within the discipline of Entomology. In trade publications, entomologists publish articles that are not necessarily addressed to a scientific audience. In fact, these are usually meant for the broader public who might have interests in the researcher’s work because of the results he has gotten, but not in the details and specific terms of such researcher’s experiments. One example of this kind of written communication, says Professor Grieshop, are bulletins for farmers, where entomologists as Dr. Isaacs and Dr. Grieshop himself, can publish articles where they explain they findings in a way that is more interesting to farmers who grow the crops they have conducted experiments on. Another case of written communication, as I mentioned before, is textbooks.  An entomologist might also teach courses at a university besides doing research, as is the case for Dr. Grieshop. In such situations, it often happens that the researcher ends up writing one or multiple textbooks on the particular area of entomology he or she is specialized in. This is a very different kind of writing from the previous ones as it has a different kind of audience, and therefore even the language used in it has to be very different from the previous ones. Through this kind of communication an entomologist wishes to convey knowledge to the audience, which in this case is students, therefore he or she has to use a language that is easily understandable, but still use some of the technical terms that students will need to learn. According to Dr. Grieshop, when communicating through textbooks, scientists wish to have students end up with a set of skills that they can then apply in the field.</p>
			<p>Another form of communication that largely influences the work done within Entomology is verbal communication. Although it may seem obvious, people often do not realize how much of it is actually done by researchers in the discipline on a daily basis. Verbal communication in Entomology involves not only simple chatting among colleagues, but it also includes  conferences that might be delivered to scientists and people with a specific interest in the discipline, extension appointments for farmers and growers, lectures for students and even talks to policy makers. All these forms of verbal communication, as it was with writing, have different audiences they’re intended for, and therefore the researcher has to be prepared to use different types of  languages, from a more technical one in conferences, to a more simple in lectures for students. Dr. Isaacs says that one of his major concerns when preparing for talks along with the language is also the content he is going to expose in his speech. In fact,  an entomologist, even if he is going to be talking about the same topic, has to be able to make slight changes in the content of his speech, according to the audience, says Professor Isaacs, so that the information given is more engaging. This is true for all types of verbal communication that entomologists have to face, but in my opinion, two of them need special attention. The first is lectures for students. According to Dr. Grieshop this type of face to face communication is fundamental when interacting with students. This, says Professor Grieshop, has become even more evident in the last few years with the increase in the presence of technology in our everyday life. In fact, it is important for professors in Entomology, that students acquire the necessary skills to be able to face jobs in the field and in contact with people. However, this can only happen, according to Dr. Grieshop, through verbal communication, as that relationship is needed for such skills to be acquired by students. The second type of verbal communication that requires further attention is talks to policy makers. In fact, says Dr.Isaacs, when preparing for these an entomologist has to be particularly careful with the type of language and the content of his speech, because any misunderstanding can lead to very harmful consequences for the farmer community. In this type of verbal communication, entomologists have to have the ability to be concise, but still clearly state their point, they have to be able to use a language that confers the needed information but is still simple and clear enough so that policy makers, who aren’t specialists in the field, can understand. Verbal communication, therefore, along with written communication, constitutes the two major types of communication involved in the discipline of entomology. </p>
