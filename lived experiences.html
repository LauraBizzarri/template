                <h1>Technology in Zoology</h1>
                <p>I am currently majoring in Zoology/Animal Science, and most people when thinking about this area of study, don’t realize how much technology is involved in it. Within Zoology, we study the anatomy of animals, ecosystems and other related subjects, but we also have to learn statistics for example in order to be able to infer data from our research in the future. However, it would be almost impossible to apply our knowledge without the help of technologies such as computers, and more specifically modeling, mapping and statistics programs. In fact, these programs help us make sense of the data that we collect during our experiments, to be able to see if they support what we were trying to prove, our hypothesis. </p>
                <p>There are different types of statistics programs that help zoologists, but ultimately any kind of researcher, to organize data. Without these, it would almost impossible to do all the necessary calculations. In a statistics class I took last semester, we were asked to do all the calculations by ourselves without the aid of any computer program. This was only to help us better understand the meaning of what we were calculating and therefore understand our results. However, this is not what researchers in real life do. If for example a zoologist is taking all the data from observation of a particular population, he isn’t going to calculate the mean, or do a t-test on his own, he probably is going to use some kind of computer program to have all the calculations made for him. The use of these statistics programs also allow for researchers from across the globe to compare their data. In fact, in these computer programs a common “statistical language” is used that makes data comparison and sharing faster and more convenient. If for example two researchers are studying the same species of animal that lives on two different parts of the world and then they decide to compare their data to see if there are any commonalities it is easier to do so by sharing the data calculated through the statistics programs. This is because both researchers will be able to understand what the data mean even if they don’t speak the same language.</p>
                <p>Zoologists and biologists in general, widely use modeling and mapping programs as well. Modeling programs also called simulation programs, allow zoologists to do experiments without actually having to collect data multiple times. A modeling program would allow a zoologist who is studying the behavior and patterns of movement of a population, to predict how the population is going to behave based on specific conditions, like weather, environment and so forth. To do this the zoologist would need to collect data only once and then based on the pattern he/she sees, recreate the experiment and bring it on only through the modeling program. Mapping programs are the other type of computer program that zoologists and biologists in general use quite often.  These programs allow taking maps and recording data on them to keep track of the sites visited and the data collected in each specific site. Another very important thing that mapping programs allow  to do is drawing on the map the shape of the field or area studied, which will make it easier for the researchers to later analyze the data collected. Both these types of programs are a huge advantage for biologists because, when they can be used, they allow money and time saving which are both fundamental in research.</p>
                <p>Currently I am working in a lab in the Department of Entomology. Entomology is a field that is very close to zoology as it studies insects. In our lab, we are currently conducting research four different types of insects, bees, fruit flies and grape moths.  During the summer, we had been collecting data for a few different projects we’re working on, and after the summer we faced the problem of putting all of our data together and interpreting it in order to see if our results were going to be useful for future projects. To do this we used mapping programs to keep track of the field sites we had been working at. For example for our blueberry field sites we used a mapping program to delimit on the map the areas we have been checking for data during the summer and flag them with different colors based on the type of treatment, either an insecticide or an attractant, they had received. This was useful in that it will help us in keeping track of what we have done so far for future references. For example, next summer we will be able to look at the maps developed through the mapping program and identify the different fields to either continue with the same treatment, if it was successful, or change to another one. In the lab, we have also used modeling programs in two instances. The first time we used the modeling program it was to see if the behavior pattern of bees in wildflower plantings was consistent over time and at the same time predict how it was probably going to be in the future. Using the data from multiple years and plugging it into the modeling program, we were able to verify our original hypothesis, and to show that planting wildflower seeds does increase the amount of bees that visit the site. The second time we used a modeling program was to track and predict the movement of fruit flies in blueberry fields across Michigan. Again, we used data from different years to get a possible prediction of the movement of the flies. A useful characteristic in modeling programs is that you can account for various external factors that might influence your model. For example in keeping track of the bees we took into account how much it had rained each year, or the average temperature at the time when the bees started to come out. A similar thing happened with the flies. Since we knew that they usually start to appear in the fields when temperatures get warmer, by taking the average temperature of the period when we started to see them the previous years, we were then able to predict through the modeling program the ideal temperature for the pupae to start hatching. The use of such programs also allowed us to compare data with other labs from different universities across the country, both for the bees and the flies, and within different years. </p>
                <p>I have always found fascinating how even such naturalistic areas such as zoology or entomology are strictly related to technology. In fact, we wouldn’t be able to carry out most of our research without the aid of at least a computer, better if with modeling, mapping and statistics programs in it. Before coming to college, I had never realized the importance of technology in zoology or entomology and I think that my experience at the entomology lab has really helped me grasp how useful it is to be able to have such aids, even looking at a possible future career in research within zoology, or some other related field. In fact, there are many other scientific fields that utilize these kinds of programs. </p>
