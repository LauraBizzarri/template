                        <h1>Blog entry 1</h1>
                        <p>The purpose of the video was to show people, and in particular people within the gay community, 
                        the hardships that many gay people have to face. To do this the author used a personal letter addressed to his uncle. 
                        The video starts out showing the letter the author wrote to his uncle and then the author himself appears to recite the letter. I think that this structure helped the author get the attention of the audience.
                        In fact, I think that using a personal letter is avery effective way to address such a topic. If for example, the author only stated his opinion the audience might have wandered how he knows what he's saying. 
                        However, talking aboout his personal experience first amd then eventually getting to making broader statements addressed to people in his same situation, is a better way to make the audience interested.
                        The video is actually very helpful, becuase it shows a way in which an effective narrative could be structured, to make it more personal but also address a broader topic.</p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 2</h1>
                        <p>The target audience of the video is people whose lives are greatly affected by video games or other types of technology. The social issue depicted in this episode of South Park, is that nowadays many people spend a lot of their time video gaming. This can become a serious problem as more and more people are attracted to video games and get addicted to them. In fact, just like addictive drugs can have harmful effects on people on the long run, so do video games. If someone spends too much time playing them, the risk is that they will end up separating themselves from reality, and not having any type of social interactions, outside of the game. Social interactions, even though many people don't realize it, are a very important part of people's lives, and help them maintain mental as well as physical stability. I think, that the bad effects that too much video gaming can have on people is mainly what the creators of the show were trying to portray. In fact, throughout the episode when they referred to players who had achieved higher levels in the game, and had therefore played for a longer time, as people with 'no life'. This means that those people spent so much time on the video game that they ended up being completely detached from reality and deprived of any social interaction. This, in my opinion, was the creators' view on this particular social issue.</p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 3</h1>
                        <p>This week we had to turn in our first project. This was the lived experiences project, where we had to describe our major and a piece of technology that is used within the field we are majoring in, and/or that affected our choice of a major. I enjoyed this project as it allowed for the use of an informal tone. Another reason I liked this project is that I've always found the piece of technology I described very interesting. What I decided to describe in my project are mapping and modeling computer programs, that are commonly used within the field of Zoology, especially in wildlife conservation. This week we also had to complete another part of the codecademy instruction program. I think that even though the coding that we are learning through codecademy is complicated, it is also nice to be able to write these types of codes in case I will need them sometimes  in the future. It is also nice to see all the work behind websites and simple things like links on the websites we visit on a daily basis. In class this week, our next project was also introduced which is going to be a cultural analysis project. I think it's going to be interesting to find a social issue and describe it, as well as find a possible solution to it. </p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 4</h1>
                        <p>We were shown a Chrysler commercial which featured the city of Detroit as well as the popular rapper Eminem. I think that the imagery of the city of Detroit was one of  city that has hard work at its soul, and that has been through hard times but has always been able to get itself out of it. Even though it is known to many people that the city of Detroit has been through really rough times, I think that this advertisement was able to depict Detroit in a better light then it usually is in other situations. The use of Eminem as a celebrity representative for the motor company I think helped to increase the effectiveness of the commercial. In fact, many people might be more drawn to buy that car or another model of the same brand because they saw a famous rapper in the commercial. This might be an unconscious process but it's an effective one, as its wide use in advertisements shows. The narrator's voice that was describing the city of Detroit as a city that's been able to stand back up after rough times, I think was another very effective way of drawing the audience's attention. In fact, what the voice says, the tone of it, as well as some of the 'challenging questions' it says, are ways to make the viewer feel more involved and drawn towards the advertised car. I think that because of all these techniques the ad achieved its purpose of making the audience more interested in their product.  </p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 5</h1>
                        <p>This week we had to turn in the draft for our cultural analysis project. I think that the fact of having to turn in a draft was useful in making us really start thinking about our project as well as concretely start putting down some thoughts. For this draft I have also already started doing some research to possibly find an article that could back up my ideas on the social issue I chose. For this cultural analysis project we will also have to make a web version with multiple pages. We had to do something similar for our lived experience project too, but that was easier as it didn't  require multiple pages. On codecademy we had to start our CSS section. I actually think CSS coding is easier in some aspects than HTML coding. In fact, even though there's a few rules you have to remember to make your codes actually work, I think they're more straightforward once you actually understand how they work.  </p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 6</h1>
                        <p>We are closing up on our cultural analysis project. I have  to say, it's been challenging to write this report but I enjoyed learning so much about the social issue I chose, which was classism. In the project we also had to include a piece of technology, such as TV shows, movies, video games etcetera, that could provide an example of our social issue. To do this, I talked about the popular TV show Gossip Girl. I think that classism is quite clearly shown in this series and therefore I thought it could be a good example. As for the solution we had to propose for the social issue, I'm not 100% sure mine will be good, but I really believe that raising awareness about the issue is truly important in order to be able to eventually solve this issue. The formal research project was also introduced to us this week. I have mixed feelings about it. I think it's going to be interesting to see how communication and technology affect Entomology, which is the field I'm probably going to talk about in my project. On the other hand, I'm also worried about the length of the paper. It's going to be quite a challenge, but hopefully I'll be able to do it! Another thing about the project that I found interesting is that we have to conduct two interviews with two experts in the field we're going to talk about, so hopefully that's going to be an interesting experience.  </p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 7</h1>
                        <p>This week we have to turn in an annotated bibliography for our formal research project. It's been really hard for me to find papers that I will be able to use in my essay, but overall I think that the ones I ended up chosing will be good ones, if I'll be able to explain and break them down clearly enough. Since one of the requirements for this project is for us to include the break down of at least one reasearch paper from a scientific journal and one from a trade pubblication, this activity I think will be very useful in achieving that. I'm also contuining the codecademy sections, and even though they are still sometimes confusing, they're starting to become a little bit clearer after every new section, and with some practice. I've also started to think about the two people I would like to interview for my formal research project, but I haven't contacted them yet. Hopefully I will be able to get the interviews done early and get some useful information about the role of communication and technology in Entomology. </p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 8</h1>
                        <p>The drafting activity of our formal research project is due this week. Basically what this activity required us to do is write down a few brief paragraphs with the main ideas that we are going to develop in our paper. I found this activity very useful in helping me to start organizing my thoughts as well as to start giving a structure to my paper. Another useful thing about the drafting activity is that by having to start organizing my ideas in a clearer way I was able to see what parts I will be able to finish smoothly adn what others require still further research. Besides this drafting activity, I will continue to work on the final version of my formal research project, but I have to get the two interviews done before I can really go any further, since I think they will both have a very important part in my essay. In fact, I'm hoping that along with the papers I've found they will be a good source of information on which to base my project. The good news regarding the interviews is that I was finally able to set appointments with the two professors I would like to interview.  </p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 9</h1>
                        <p>Last week was spring break so we didn't have class, but I continued to work on my formal research project. I was finally able to get the two interviews done. The first interview I conducted was with Rufus Isaacs, professor in the Department of Entomology at Michigan State University. I think the interview with him was very useful to understand how important communication is within Entomology. He was also very helpful in explaining what are some of the main types of communication that he uses the most in his daily job as a reasercher. The other interview I had was with Matthew Grieshop, also professor in the Department of Entomology at MSU. Some useful information I was able to get from the interview with him was related to teaching within Entomology ans more specifically how communication and technology affect it. I'm really happy with all the information I was able to gather as it really helped me get an even clearer idea about how I would like my project to end up like. This week I will continue to work on the project by trying to integrate the two interviews and see if I need anything else for the final draft which will be due next week. </p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 10</h1>
                        <p>The final draft of our formal research project is due this week. I have pretty much the whole paper done except for a few final details. It was rough to write this essay as it was the longest of the semester but I have to say I'm happy with what I was able to achieve. I think this was a useful assignment as it helped me to learn even better how to conduct research, as well as interviews, and draw from them information that can be used in a useful way. Another thing that this assignment tought me is the importance of how you actually set up your interviews. In fact, you have to have clear what kind of information you want to get out of the interview, and you have to be able to formulate questions in a way that the interviewee will provide you with the information you are looking for to support your statements. This week the next project was also introduced, which is going to be a multimedia remix project. This will be a group project, so hopefully we will be able to work well together. In class we were also shown a documentary that's going to kind of set an example for the short documentary we'll have to create with our groups. After watching the documentary we had to fill out a documentary worksheet where we basically commented the main features of the documentary. I think this assignment was useful in helping me understand what are some techniques that we could use to make our documentary more interesting to the audience. </p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 11</h1>
                        <p>Last week the multimedia remix project was introduced to us and then we had to get together in our assigned groups to decide what we are going to do for the project and set up meetings out of class to get more things done. What this multimedia research project requires us to is take one of the previous projects of one of our group members and make it into a documentary. With my group we decided to work on the formal research project of one of the members. This project was on his major of advertising, which all of us found really interesting as exept for him we didn't really know anything about advertising. I really hope we can get a good documentary out of it. We have also been working on our remix project proposal. In this assignment we basically had to draft an outline of the sections that are going to make up our documentary, and what content we would like to include in each of these sections. We also had to assign different roles to the the makers and participants of the video. We also had to address some possible audience biases and conflicts, although it was harder for us to do this as we didn't chose a social issue from our cultural analysis project as the subject of our video.</p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 12</h1>
                        <p>This week we didn't have anything new in class but instead we were given the time to work on our multimedia remix project. With the other members of my group we met outside of class and started looking for material that we would like to put in the video. We looked for a few fun and/or interesting facts, that might help us get the audience interested in our documentary. In addition we also did some research on what type of information we should include in our description of the major of advertising so that the viewers can get enough information to udnerstand what advertising is but at the same time not overwhelm them with too much information. We also tryed to figure out,with the help of the group member that is actually majoring in advertising, what advertising techniques we would want to incorporate in our short documentary.  </p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 13</h1>
                        <p>We are still continuing to work on our multimedia remix projects. Our next project was also introduced to us this week, and it's going to be a final retrospective project. What this assignment will require us to do is, revise our past projects and various assignments. In doing this we will have to describe each assignment and what  we learne from it, as well as what types of writing we encountered throughout the semester. The overall purpose of this assignment will be to give future students who might be taking this same class an idea of what college writing is about and what they might expect from it. I think this assignment will be a good way of revising all the work I've done in this class throughout the semester and think about the skills that I have acquired. The draft for this project along with the final version of our short documentary will be due next week. This final retrospective project also includes a second part that will be done in groups and then turned in as a class. What this second part consists of is writing a description and revision of one of the past assignments and then turn it in to the web design group that will be in charge of creating a class web version. </p>
                
                        <h1>Blog entry 14</h1>
                        <p>The final version of our multimedia remix project ws due this week. We were able to finish everything we wanted to include in the video. Even though we were initially worried that we wouldn't be able to  make the documentary as long as it had to be, we actually ended up having to cut out one of the sequences we had originally planned to insert. In my opinion we were able to make a really got and interesting documentary, using the techniques for effectiveness we had learned by watching the documentary and commercials in class. Along with the final version of our documentary, we had to turn in a memo about how working in our grous was, as well as some general comments about the video and the creative process. I think this was a good opportunity to evaluate the group work as well as the work that went into making the video. The draft for our final retrospective project was also due this week. I was able to get it done and I think that it won't be to hard to go from there and finish the whole paper. So far I've written a little bit about the first three major assignments, but I plan on adding something about how my experience with the projects as well as something about our multimedia remix project. To do this last thing I wanted to actually wait to finish the documentary and be able to think about the whole process .</p>
