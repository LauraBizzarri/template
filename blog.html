                        <p>The purpose of the video was to show people, and in particular people within the gay community, 
                        the hardships that many gay people have to face. To do this the author used a personal letter addressed to his uncle. 
                        The video starts out showing the letter the author wrote to his uncle and then the author himself appears to recite the letter. I think that this structure helped the author get the attention of the audience.
                        In fact, I think that using a personal letter is avery effective way to address such a topic. If for example, the author only stated his opinion the audience might have wandered how he knows what he's saying. 
                        However, talking aboout his personal experience first amd then eventually getting to making broader statements addressed to people in his same situation, is a better way to make the audience interested.
                        The video is actually very helpful, becuase it shows a way in which an effective narrative could be structured, to make it more personal but also address a broader topic.</p>
