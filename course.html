		<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
		<p>Within this course, we were asked to complete four major written assignments. The first three of these major projects focused on a specific type of writing that will be in some way useful to us in the future when we perhaps go on to graduate school or even a job. Even though the three assignments were different from each other, they all had some common requirements that needed to be followed. In fact, they all required us to truly consider the aim of our project, to keep in mind the type of audience that would be likely to read it, as well as the message or information that we wanted to convey through the paper. Considering the audience, not only means writing a clear, easily readable paper, but also understanding what kind of information the audience is likely to understand immediately and what needs more explanation. Paying particular attention to the reader implies also that the writer needs to be able to predict what types of biases the reader might run into, and to know how to make sure that this doesn’t happen, or that if it does, the audience can find a way to break that bias by reading the paper. The fourth major assignment was a group project where we had to remake one of our previous projects into a short documentary. This project allowed us to explore another kind of communication that is becoming more and more popular. </p>
		<p>The first project we worked on during this course was a lived experiences project. In particular, we were asked to analyze how a specific piece technology affects our major and possibly how it has affected our choice of our major. First of all, we had to identify and describe  our major and a possible future career path. Even in simply doing so, we already had to take into consideration a possible audience. In fact, not everyone might be familiar with the major we chose or the piece of technology we intended to describe. Therefore, it was important that we were able to convey the necessary information for the reader to understand, but at the same time not give too many superficial details, so that the reader would still be interested and continued to read on. However, even though through this paper we were trying to describe our major and a piece of technology important to that major, the tone of it was a more informal one, even allowing us to write in the first person throughout the paper. For this project I described my major of zoology and a piece of technology that is widely used within this field, such as mapping and modeling programs. Both my major and the type of technology I chose to describe in this project, required clear explanation, as not all readers might be familiar with what zoology is and even more particularly what mapping and modeling programs are. Another requirement of this paper was to describe a personal experience that has helped us in deciding to pursue our major, or that has otherwise influenced our major. To accomplish this I described how modeling and mapping programs are used in the lab I currently work in. This is a type of information that in addition to helping the reader get more interested in the topic, also gives an example of a real life application of the piece of technology described. I think this paper was useful to be able to learn how to write in an informal way, and make the reading a lighter one but still convey information to the audience. Even though this kind of writing might not be too frequent in other college courses or academic settings, it would still probably turn out to be suited for other occasions in life.</p>
		<p>The second major assignment we worked on during this course was a cultural analysis proposal. This project required us to make a further step towards a more formal type of writing. This was achieved by taking into consideration a major social issue and analyzing it, by also describing a piece of technology that represents that social issue, and finally by providing a possible solution to the issue. In this assignment as well, it was fundamental for us to consider carefully our audience to make sure that the understanding of the main message would be complete. In fact, especially in this type of paper, it is truly fundamental that the audience is helped to avoid, or remove, any biases, as in fact the social issue described in the paper is mainly born out of people’s biases. However, to be able to clear the audience of any biases it is also important to provide information to back up our statements and make them believable to the reader. To achieve this it is necessary to conduct some research and possibly find studies that support our statements. In this project, I considered the social issue of classism. Since the social issue I chose to describe isn’t widely known, I had to make sure to explain clearly in my assignment what the issue is, what kind of people and areas it might affect. In addition to providing the audience with a clear explanation, I also provided an example of the issue of classism, thanks to a popular TV show, called Gossip Girl. By doing so, the reader was more likely to be able to understand the issue because of a clearer and more popular example. Another fundamental part of the assignment was to provide a possible solution. The solution I proposed to the social issue of classism was to raise more awareness about the issue first. In fact, just like the audience of my paper many other people might not even know about the existence of such an issue.  This type of writing is one that requires more attention and work than the kind used for example in our lived experiences project. I believe, that this project was particularly useful in learning to take into careful consideration the audience, and what type of information it might need to understand the content of the essay.</p>
		<p>For our third assignment we were given a formal research project. This assignment required us to take into consideration the types of communication used within a chosen field, and specifically our major, as well as the importance of technology within that field. In the project, we also had to include to interviews, as well as the analysis of two articles. By doing so, this assignment took on an even further level of formality. In fact, I believe, that the major learning outcome of this project was to be able to write in a formal way, and to conduct proper research and interviews to support our statements.  For this project I decided to describe the types of communication and technology involved in the field of entomology, which is a field very close to my major, as well as the field I currently work in besides studying. In this assignment just like the first two it was important that I described what the field of entomology is and what it implies, before I explained anything else. In fact, the audience had to have very clear what entomology is before it could understand how communication and technology affect it in many different ways. One further step compared to the first two assignments that this project required was, as I mentioned earlier, to conduct research as well as interview two experts in the field. I think that the ability to conduct research and interview, as well as critically analyze the information gathered, is the main thing I learned from this assignment. In my opinion, this will be a very useful skill throughout college, as well as in the future, especially if I plan on pursuing a career in the scientific field. </p>
		<p>The fourth assignment, asked us to turn one of our previous project into a short documentary. By doing so we explored another form of communication. Some new elements were also introduced in the work behind this project. In fact, in addition to taking into consideration the audience by carefully weighing the information that we provided, which we had already done in the previous assignments, we had to pay particular attention at the design of our video as it was the main means of communication with the audience. For this project, my group and I decided to revisit the formal research project of one of our group members on the major of advertising. The main challenges in the project were to provide enough information for the audience to understand what advertising is, and also include fun and interesting facts to keep the audience’s interest up.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, all assignments were useful in teaching us different types of communication, as well as always considering what the audience is likely to already know about the topic and what, on the contrary, needs more explanation.  What I think I gathered from the lived experiences project was how to write in a more informal way while at the same time providing interesting and maybe even useful information. From the cultural analysis assignment my biggest taking is the ability to keep the audience, with its possible biases, constantly in mind, along with the necessity for backup for my statements. The formal research project helped me learn how to conduct research and interviews, but most of all to be able to use that information to support my statements, while providing useful information to the audience. The final remix project’s main teaching to me was the ability to used another type of communication, such as a video documentary, in an effective way.</p>
