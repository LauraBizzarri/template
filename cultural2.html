			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Classism is defined as the prejudice toward people of a different social status, usually a lower one. This is a widely spread issue especially in countries where there are both very rich and very poor people. As in fact, most social classes are today based on income, if mainly poor people inhabit a nation, there are no others who the prejudice could come from. In a country like the U.S. and most of the Western societies, this is unfortunately a quite common problem even though still not recognized by most people.  However, I think it is important that more and more people start recognizing this social issue, and that people who are affected by it understand that they can get help in coping with it. </p>
