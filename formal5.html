			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>Technology is another factor that greatly influences Entomology and the research done within it. There are several different types of technology involved in this discipline, but a few major ones are computers, cell phones, molecular technologies, GPS tracking devices and other technological instruments. The role of computers might be obvious, but there is a lot more to consider then what most people would think. In fact, computers give the ability to entomologists to communicate with each other through emails and social networks. Therefore, in this, it is possible to see a close relationship between technology and communication within Entomology.  In this sense, the role that cell phone technology plays is quite similar to that of computers, as they both provide a faster way to communicate, without being bounded by geographic barriers. Going back to evaluating computers, their importance goes beyond simple communication. They also provide researchers with a means of conducting faster data analysis through computer programs. In fact, according to Dr. Isaacs, that this has a much greater impact on an entomologistâ€™s day-to-day work than most people realize. Just twenty years ago, says Professor Isaacs, to have the data that a researcher collected analyzed, they would have had to send it to a different location where they could have done the data analysis and then send back the results. Therefore, it is an enormous help to have the possibility for entomologists, as well as other researchers, to do this kind of task on their own computer, as it allows them to save a lot of time, that can be used towards other projects. Computers also give entomologists the opportunity to communicate through websites and social media. In fact, many researchers have a web page of their own where it is possible for people to find their curriculum vitae, the projects they are working on, or they have been working on in the past, as well as papers and articles that they have published. In addition, it is increasingly common for entomologists to be on social media websites, and this is possible thanks to computers. Social media is another way that nowadays researchers can communicate fast and be up-to-date with each other. Molecular technologies are a type of technology other than computers that largely influence the work done by researchers. In fact, for some experiments entomologists may need to extract specific chemicals and substances, such as pheromones and hormones from insects, or they might even need to extract their DNA and RNA, to be able to make comparisons across populations or to prepare traps and baits for insects. All of these tasks can only be accomplished thanks to molecular technologies. These are nowadays so sophisticated and yet easy to use that many entomologists can do it themselves in their own labs, with some basic knowledge, without the need to send samples to other specialized labs. Finally, GPS tracking devices and radios are another category of technology that is greatly useful to entomologists. GPS tracking devices allow researchers to keep track of field sites and therefore make it easier for entomologists to continue their work across multiple field seasons. There are many other technological instruments that entomologists use in their jobs, and one good example is provided in an article from a trade publication, on microphones specialized in detecting black vine weevils. This article states that these microphones have a huge influence on the nursery industry, as they allow the nurseries to detect the insects faster and therefore save money on hiring pest scouts who could process the plants far slower than the device. This kind of device is one of many other technologies used by entomologists to be more efficient. </p>
